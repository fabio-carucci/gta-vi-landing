# GTA VI Scroll Landing

A cinematic, scroll-driven landing page that recreates the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer experience in the browser.

Built with **React + Vite**, powered by **GSAP ScrollTrigger** and **@gsap/react** for silky-smooth, frame-perfect animations.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Scroll-based storytelling** – every section (Hero, character reveals, videos, outro) is tied to the scroll position for an immersive narrative flow.
- **Pinned video sequences** – videos play forward in perfect sync with the user’s scroll thanks to `currentTime` tweening.
- **SVG text masking** – dynamic text reveal using CSS `mask-image`.
- **Fluid parallax imagery** – character artwork slides subtly with easing for depth.
- **Tailwind-powered layout** – rapid, responsive styling with utility classes.

## ⚙️ Key Technical Notes

| Topic               | Implementation                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ScrollTrigger setup | Each section creates its own GSAP timeline with `scrub`, `pin`, and custom `start`/`end` markers to control when the animation runs.                      |
| Video scrubbing     | `onloadedmetadata` fires once the video’s duration is known, then GSAP tweens `currentTime` from `0` → `duration` so playback tracks the scroll position. |
| Section offsets     | Large negative `marginTop` values (e.g. `-150dvh`) position hidden content well below/above the viewport so it can slide in without jank.                 |
| Tailwind            | Tailwind is injected via `index.css`; no additional config is required thanks to Vite’s PostCSS pipeline.                                                 |
